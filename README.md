# Tildepot

A basic command line tool to manage OS & home directory setup, including applications, dotfiles, preferences, and more. If you can script it, you can manage it.

This is a small, good-enough pet project. Only tested in macOS.

## Motivation

Examples of tasks this tool aims to streamline:

- Install/update/uninstall applications via your package manager of choice
- Install/update/uninstall misc applications (for those not available in any package manager)
- Manage dot files
- Manage misc files & folders
- Store & restore various preferences, e.g. app preferences, crontab, etc.
- Automate one-time OS & user setups

Unlike many other tools (e.g. [Nix](https://nixos.org/)), Tildepot is a very basic, mostly imperative tool: No abstract declaration files, just basic shell scripts.

## Setup
